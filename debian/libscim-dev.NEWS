scim (1.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Since version 1.4.5, scim has changed the $(moduledir) variable in the
  scim.pc file, from "/usr/lib/scim-1.0" to "/usr/lib/scim-1.0/1.4.0".
  This means the SCIM module packages that built against the new
  libscim-dev package will have their files installed to a different
  path.

  Therefore, all those SCIM module packages that used a patch to install
  the module files in paths such as $(moduledir)/1.4.0/IMEngine/ should
  drop the patch and just install the files in $(moduledir)/IMEngine/,
  and bump build dependency to libscim-dev (>= 1.4.6-1).  This will keep
  the files installed in the same /usr/lib/scim-1.0/1.4.0/IMEngine/
  path.  Packages that didn't have such a patch should pay attention
  that their module files will be installed in a different path and
  adjust accordingly (but don't add patch to put the files back to paths
  like /usr/lib/scim-1.0/IMEngine/, those files should be put into
  ABI-version specific paths).
