1.4.0
-----
Update to Debian policy 3.6.2.

Revise README.Debian and man page.


Long Term
---------
Tighten xlibs-dev build-dependence (perhaps to libx11-dev and x-dev, but
right now the configure script requires libxt-dev for X11/Intrinsic.h)

Add im-switch support.

Investigate "SONAME in dynamic loaded module" issue.
