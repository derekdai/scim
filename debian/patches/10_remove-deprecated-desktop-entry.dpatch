## 10_remove-deprecated-desktop-entry.dpatch by Ming Hua <minghua-guest@users.alioth.debian.org>
##
## All lines beginning with `## DP:' are a description of the patch.
##
## DP: The freedesktop standard desktop entry location [1] is
## DP: /usr/share/applications/, so we stop installing scim-setup.desktop into
## DP: /usr/share/control-center-2.0/capplets/.
## DP:
## DP: NOTE:  This patch only changes extras/setup/Makefile.am, and the change
## DP: necessary for extras/setup/Makefile.in is incorporated in
## DP: 90_relibtoolize.dpatch.  If the relibtoolize patch is removed, this
## DP: patch should change extras/setup/Makefile.in as well.
## DP:
## DP: 1. For example, see
## DP:    http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/1.0/ar01s02.html
