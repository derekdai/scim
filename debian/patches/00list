# Patch naming guideline:
# - Please use ##_xxx-xxx.dpatch pattern for naming the patch.  ## is a
#   two digit number, and xxx-xxx describe the content of the patch.
# - Use number 0# for patches pulled from upstream CVS.
# - Group patches of similar usage with the same first digit.
# - Note the patches are applied in the order of their numbers.  So if
#   you insert a new patch, make sure all the patches after it applies
#   correctly.
